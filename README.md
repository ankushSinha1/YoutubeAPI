This application uses youtubeapi to fetch a given number of youtube search results based on user's search query.
It shows a mock youtube page where a particular video can be played on the web page. It uses React to update the web page whenever required.
It lacks good amount of CSS but it doesn't matter really. Visit the site at: https://youtube-api-eight.vercel.app/
